# DAiSEE Dataset
================

The DAiSEE dataset is a multi-label video classification dataset for recognizing user affective states in e-learning environments. It contains 9068 video snippets captured from 112 users, annotated with four levels of labels (very low, low, high, and very high) for each of the affective states (boredom, confusion, engagement, and frustration).

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 15 GB of video files, along with a README file and a few scripts to get you started.

## Authors

The DAiSEE dataset was created by Abhay Gupta, Arjun D'Cunha, Kamal Awasthi, and Vineeth Balasubramanian.
